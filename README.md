# Sorting Hat

## Description
This application will allow a user to enter the name of a Hogwarts student and randomly assign him or her to one of the Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). The user will also be able to expel a student after they have been sorted. This will remove their card from student records.
